# Commentarii de Pilinio

A brief work log updated every few days. Caesar allusions are plenty.

With the Avernii being subdued, Richard and Michael at the end of the week were able to parse at least one word from every part of speech currently supported by Tabulae in the Allen and Greenough repository. Many, but not all of these rules have found there way into the parser for Pliny.

In addition they compiled a list of the all the vocabulary in the first section of Pliny. From this list, they intend to parse each word and have at least one full chunk of Pliny completely parsed. The resulting workflow would essentially be bouncing back between parsing Pliny and *A&G*, and cherrypicking rules in *A&G* needed for Pliny.
