The Plinius project is currently primarily focused on creating a diplomatic, digital edition of Staatsbibliothek Bamberg Msc.Class.42. The Bamberg manuscript contains books 32-37 of Pliny the Elder's *Natrual Histories*. It was created in Aachen
in Louis the Pious' palace scriptorum sometime during the second quarter of the ninth century. It is, therefore, one of the oldest manuscripts of Pliny's work.

While we hope to expand the project to encompass other books, current focus is on Book 36, as it contains a large amount of information on ancient sculpture.
